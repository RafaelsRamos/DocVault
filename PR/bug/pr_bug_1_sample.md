### Issue
When loading the home screen with **setting A** enabled, users are experience an incorrect feed - for more information, see #1234.

### What does this PR do?
- Ensure correct filtering when **setting A** is enabled, by tweaking filtering logic at *FilterLogic.js*. An alternative approach would be to do X. The reason I opted for Y approach was A, B, and C;
- Minor refactor on *SortLogic.js*;
- Fix typo on translations file;
- closes #1234

I appreciate the review! Please let me know if you disagree with following the approach Y in deteriment of X.
