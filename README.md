### Style-Guide

Creating a Style-Guide for a growing project with more engineers has many benefits. Here are some key points:

1. **Easier Pull Requests:** The Style-Guide is like a rulebook, making it simpler to review and discuss changes without arguing over personal preferences.

2. **Helps New Team Members:** Newcomers can use the Style-Guide as a guide to understand how the team writes code, making it easier for them to fit in.

3. **Focus on Important Stuff:** With a Style-Guide, the team can concentrate on discussing the essential parts of the code, like how it works and if it meets the project's goals, instead of arguing about small style choices.

4. **Automatic Checks:** Tools can be set up to automatically check if the code follows the Style-Guide. This catches mistakes early and keeps the code consistent.

5. **Consistency Across Projects:** Using one Style-Guide for all projects helps keep things consistent. It makes it easier for team members to switch between different projects without feeling lost.

But it's essential to find a balance. The Style-Guide should guide without being too strict. Regular updates are also necessary to keep up with changes in technology and the team's needs.
